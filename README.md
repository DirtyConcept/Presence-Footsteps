## Mods, Modpacks, Resource Packs & Customisation

By default Presence Foosteps only contains mappings for vanilla minecraft blocks and entities, but that doesn't mean you have to be restricted to
what it has on its own! Presence Footsteps is completely and fully customisable. If you're interested in knowing how to change or add your own sounds,
or if you're a modder/modpack creator who wants to know how to add support for your favourite mod, I suggest reading [this page on how to create a resource pack](https://github.com/Sollace/Presence-Footsteps/wiki/Information-for-Resourcepack-Creators) to customise this mod.

Things you can change include:
 - The sounds included in the mod
 - The material a certain block is recognised as
 - The sounds to play for certain materials, as well as timing and overlapping of these sounds
 - Sounds to play when walking on entities of certain types
 - The footstep pattern (stances) of each type of entity
